TODO:

1. Observe the Z3 VC. See why it's timing out. Ints? 
Yes. Also, the encoding of SO, which uses Ints..

With k=20:
- After removing mkkey_int and commutativity (but with "hbid"):
  - Verification time > 5m. Counterexample time = 2m38s
- After removing hbid:
  - Verification time > 3m. Counterexample time = 25s. 
- After removing "declare-datatypes":
  - Verification time = 10m. Counterexample time = 6s.
2. Change the encoding of Ints and SO. Does the performance increase?
3. Change the encoding of commutativity. Simplify it.
